# TeachZ80 Hardware

Currently version 1.2 is the first version released

##Design
Teach Z80 is designed with the free, web-based EasyEDA (Standard) service. The whole project is publicly shared on OSHWLab [here](https://www.google.com](https://oshwlab.com/luethich80/pb-z80)https://oshwlab.com/luethich80/pb-z80). Feel free to access the project for detailled information, or clone the project and change it as you like.
Currently, the BOM includes only parts which are assembled by the JLCPCB assembly service. If a full BOM including additional components to finish the board, please let me know and I will create it.
